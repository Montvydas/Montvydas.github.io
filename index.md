## Hacks and Projects by Monty

Hey everyone, my name is Monty and in this website I will be posting cool electronics projects and various. other hacks, thus stay tuned in!

### Some Backstory

I was born and raised in Lithuania, but after Secondary school moved to Study electronics in Edinburgh. Throughout my journey I worked for various companies such as Cirrus Logic, ARM, etc. Right now I am trying to open a new page in life and thus moved to sunny Valencia, where I will be re-learning a lot of things in order to make cool electronics projects. 


### Projects

At the moment I am actively working on 4 projects... Arduino based nano quadcopter, NFC ring, emotion measuring ring and a nice mug warmer to keep me sane while I am working on the projects!
